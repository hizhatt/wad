                <h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Subaru Natsuki is a NEET who does nothing but play games. One night, after visiting a convenience store, he is suddenly summoned to another world. With no sign of who summoned him, he soon befriends a silver-haired half-elf girl who introduces herself as Satella, and her companion Puck. Satella mentions that her insignia was stolen by a thief named Felt. When he and "Satella" are mysteriously killed, Subaru awakens and discovers that he has acquired an ability which he names "Return by Death," enabling him to reverse time by dying. He greets "Satella" again, only for her to be offended at being addressed by the name "Satella," which in fact refers to the "Witch of Envy," and is considered a taboo. With the help of Reinhard (a knight) in another timeline, Subaru saves "Satella's" life from the assassin Elsa; she reveals that her real name is Emilia, and as a token of gratitude, Felt returns the insignia to her.
				<br>
				<br>
				While recovering at the margrave Roswaal's mansion, the mage Beatrice drains Subaru's mana. After waking up, he meets the twin maids Ram and Rem, as well as Roswaal, who hires him as a butler at Subaru's request. Roswaal reveals that Emilia needed the insignia to qualify as a candidate in the upcoming royal election. After mysteriously dying again, Subaru decides to investigate the circumstances leading to his death, and tries to recreate these events. Following a series of traumatic deaths and revivals, he learns that a curse had been placed on him, then deduces it came from a village he had visited earlier, while also resolving Rem's intense hatred for witches. Eventually, the village is threatened by creatures known as mabeasts, demonic beasts that are rumored to have been created by a witch to wipe out humanity, so Subaru, Rem and Ram have to rescue the villagers.	
				<br> <br>
                However, everytime Subaru dies in every fight he has been, he will immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.

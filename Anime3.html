                <h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he 
                    indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his 
                    air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed "Daru." The three pass the time by 
                    tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange 
                    function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.<br>
                    <br>
                    Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific 
                    breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before 
                    stumbling upon an unexpected successâ€”the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history.<br>
                    <br>
                    Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe through the depths 
                    of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder 
                    the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.
